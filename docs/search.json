    "text": "Rat Graph\nThis graph shows the proportion of rats per person for each state. One might use this if they have either a strong like or dislike for rats and are willing to relocate accordingly. Someone who really loves rats and would like to cohabitate with them may wish to check out New York, as we see that there is about a rat for each person residing there. On the other hand, someone who is looking to stay as far away as possible might have better luck with somewhere like Colorado, where they will find closer to one rat for every ten people."

    "text": "2016 WI Congressional Districts\nThis map shows the congressional Districts in WI as of 2016. The colors from blue to red represent how respectively Democratic or Republican that district voted in the 2016 elections for Congress.\nOne interesting aspect is the shapes of the districts. We see that some districts, like Districts 3 & 4 are very oddly shaped. District 3 seems to reach up into areas like Stevens Point and Eau Claire, while District 4 is by far the smallest, and covers little more than Milwaukee. This could bring up accusations of gerrymandering, especially seeing as the two weirdest shaped districts are also 2 of the 3 that elected Democratic Representatives. If, for example, District 4 was a bit bigger, it might draw some of the republican votes away from their respective districts and make those districts more competitive and at risk of turning blue. The size of District 7 is also notable. It is likely that there are some more liberal areas in NW Wisconsin around Superior, however their votes would be cancelled out by the large span of conservative areas in northcentral WI.\nWe also see that the darkness of the color corresponds to the proportion of votes. For example, districts 3 & 4 have no Republican votes because they were uncontested competitions. The majority of the Republican winning counties had around 60-65% of the vote.\nWI Governor Evers recently signed a bill passing a new Legislative Districts map to combat some of this gerrymandering, however thus far the Congressional Districts have remained the same."

This can allow us to stack different types of charts about the same data, as shown below, and it also has many benefits pertaining to looking at connections between variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis next chart is just an example of how you can facet these charts. You can, of course, have multiple circles that all display data and charts, however for this example I choose to just play with their colors and brightness.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the first two graphs were just playing around with the package with random variables, this last graph is a real world example of how the circlize package might be used. The World Phones dataset shows the amount of phones in different regions of the world throughout a few years. I am using it with the chordDiagram function to show where there were phones in the regions throughout the years.\n# Load circlize package\nlibrary(circlize)\n\n# Load WorldPhones dataset\ndata(\"WorldPhones\")\n\n# Create a circular plot\nchordDiagram(WorldPhones, transparency = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, this link will take you to a presentation with an overview of the circlize dataset and some of its uses."

    "text": "Fat Rats!\n\nFor this project, I examined the dataset FatRats, which has data from an experiment on the effects of diet on the weight gain of rats. The study had 60 baby rat participants, which were split up into groups and fed different sources of protein (Beef, Cereal, and Pork). The resulting dataset shows the weight gain for each rat from their protein source.\nI decided to conduct a randomization-type test by simulating the behavior under the null hypothesis. I wanted to see if the results of weight gain from different protein sources is statistically significant. I did this by running simulations of the study and randomizing the protein source to see if a random test would produce significantly different responses than the experiment did.\nThe following graphs show the difference in average weight gains between different proteins with the randomized test, which shows what might happen if the type of protein had no effect. The hot pink vertical line shows the average weight gain from the study that was run. The p-values below each chart show the probability under the null hypothesis (our randomized experiment) of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one obtained. The p-values are calculated by looking at how many of the randomized statistics are greater than or equal to the observed statistics from the rat study.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeef vs. Pork p-value: 0.297 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeef vs. Cereal p-value: 0.316 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPork vs. Cereal p-value: 0.303 \n\n\nAs we can see, all of the p-values are close to 0.3. Generally, if the p-value is less than 0.05, we will consider the results of the study statistically significant. Because these results are well over the point of statistical significance, we can fail to reject the null hypothesis and claim that the difference in weight gains due to different proteins is not statistically significant."

    "text": "Did you know that in the Ratatouille movie, only 7,526 words were spoken? According to a Reddit post, the average screenplay has about 22,000 words(although Reddit is definitely not the most reliable source). Within those 7,526 words in Ratatouille, there were 2,193 distinct words spoken. This may seem like very few, but any Ratatouille lover knows how impactful those 2,193 different words were.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above graph is a sentiment analysis of all of the words in Ratatouille. To find this, I used a sentiment library that ranks common words on a scale of -3 to 3, respectively negative to positive sentiment. I inner joined that dataset with my dataset of Ratatouille words to find their sentiments. We can see that a little over half of the Ratatouille words have positive connotations. This makes sense since it is overall a happy movie, although there is a lot of yelling from the head chef which would contribute to the good chunk of negativity. This graph has the words in order of appearance, so the left is the beginning of the movie, and as the movie progresses, we move to the right. We can see areas where the movie was more positive, and also areas that were more negative.\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow we see a table with the 10 most used words in Ratatouille. To do this, I removed the stop words (common words that generally don’t hold significance like “the”) from the data and I ranked the leftover words by amount used. Unsurprisingly, we see that 3 of the words have to do with food, as it is a food movie. We also see that names/nicknames come up a lot, with Remy, Gusteau, Linguini and dad all making appearances. We see that both Gusteau and Gusteau’s are on the list because R treats them like different words, but adding them together would put Gusteau to 40 occurances and in second place behind chef. Rat is also fairly expected since the whole plot of the movie is about a rat. Somewhat surprising, however, is the word hey. I would think that it would be considered a stop word, however the set of stop words I used did not include it.\n\n\n\n\n\nword\nchef\nrat\ncook\ndad\nfood\nhey\ngusteau\nremy\nlinguini\ngusteau's\n\n\nn\n53\n33\n28\n26\n26\n23\n22\n21\n19\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile seeing these words is nice to get a taste for what the most used words are, it is also nice to have a more visual representation. Below is a word cloud containing the top 100 used words from the move. The bigger the word, the more it was used. By using a diagram like this, we can more easily see which words are the most commonly found, and the color codings show up what other words were used a similar amount of times.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother way to look at the words used is shown below. Here, we can see the top 100 words in order of number of occurrences. The graph on the left shows how many times each of those words were used in the film. This gives us the same information as the word cloud, but it is a different way of looking at it!\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we know quite a bit about the contents of Ratatouille, we can look at how some of its statistics compared to other Disney Movies. Here, I decided to find the movies with the same director as Ratatouille to compare, so the following table shows the movies from this dataset that were directed by Brad Bird.\n\n\n\n\n\ntitle\nProduction company\nRelease date\nRunning time\nDirected by\nMusic by\nBudget\n\n\n\n\nThe Incredibles\nNA\n['October 27, 2004 ( BFI London Film Festival )', 'November 5, 2004 (United States)']\n115 minutes\nBrad Bird\nMichael Giacchino\n$92 million\n\n\nRatatouille\n['Walt Disney Pictures', 'Pixar Animation Studios']\n['June 22, 2007 ( Kodak Theatre )', 'June 29, 2007 (United States)']\n111 minutes\nBrad Bird\nMichael Giacchino\n$150 million\n\n\nTomorrowland\n['Walt Disney Pictures', 'A113 Productions']\n['May 9, 2015 ( Disneyland )', 'May 22, 2015 (United States)']\n130 minutes\nBrad Bird\nMichael Giacchino\n$180–190 million\n\n\nIncredibles 2\nNA\n['June 5, 2018 ( Los Angeles )', 'June 15, 2018 (United States)']\n118 minutes\nBrad Bird\nMichael Giacchino\n$200 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI found it interesting to see that all of the movies directed by Brad Bird in this dataset had music by Michael Giacchino. Looking further, Giacchino did the music for 11 of the movies in the dataset, including some great soundtracks including Cars 2 and Up."
