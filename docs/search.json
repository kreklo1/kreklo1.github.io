    "text": "Rat Graph\nThis graph shows the proportion of rats per person for each state. One might use this if they have either a strong like or dislike for rats and are willing to relocate accordingly. Someone who really loves rats and would like to cohabitate with them may wish to check out New York, as we see that there is about a rat for each person residing there. On the other hand, someone who is looking to stay as far away as possible might have better luck with somewhere like Colorado, where they will find closer to one rat for every ten people."

    "text": "2016 WI Congressional Districts\nThis map shows the congressional Districts in WI as of 2016. The colors from blue to red represent how respectively Democratic or Republican that district voted in the 2016 elections for Congress.\nOne interesting aspect is the shapes of the districts. We see that some districts, like Districts 3 & 4 are very oddly shaped. District 3 seems to reach up into areas like Stevens Point and Eau Claire, while District 4 is by far the smallest, and covers little more than Milwaukee. This could bring up accusations of gerrymandering, especially seeing as the two weirdest shaped districts are also 2 of the 3 that elected Democratic Representatives. If, for example, District 4 was a bit bigger, it might draw some of the republican votes away from their respective districts and make those districts more competitive and at risk of turning blue. The size of District 7 is also notable. It is likely that there are some more liberal areas in NW Wisconsin around Superior, however their votes would be cancelled out by the large span of conservative areas in northcentral WI.\nWe also see that the darkness of the color corresponds to the proportion of votes. For example, districts 3 & 4 have no Republican votes because they were uncontested competitions. The majority of the Republican winning counties had around 60-65% of the vote.\nWI Governor Evers recently signed a bill passing a new Legislative Districts map to combat some of this gerrymandering, however thus far the Congressional Districts have remained the same."

    "text": "Circlize Package\nThe circlize package is very helpful in displaying data circularly. This can allow us to stack different types of charts about the same data, as shown below, and it also has many benefits pertaining to looking at connections between variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis next chart is just an example of how you can facet these charts. You can, of course, have multiple circles that all display data and charts, however for this example I choose to just play with their colors and brightness.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the first two graphs were just playing around with the package with random variables, this last graph is a real world example of how the circlize package might be used. The World Phones dataset shows the amount of phones in different regions of the world throughout a few years. I am using it with the chordDiagram function to show where there were phones in the regions throughout the years.\n# Load circlize package\nlibrary(circlize)\n\n# Load WorldPhones dataset\ndata(\"WorldPhones\")\n\n# Create a circular plot\nchordDiagram(WorldPhones, transparency = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, this link will take you to a presentation with an overview of the circlize dataset and some of its uses."

    "text": "Fat Rats!\n\nFor this project, I examined the dataset FatRats, which has data from an experiment on the effects of diet on the weight gain of rats. The study had 60 baby rat participants, which were split up into groups and fed different sources of protein (Beef, Cereal, and Pork). The resulting dataset shows the weight gain for each rat from their protein source.\nI decided to conduct a randomization-type test by simulating the behavior under the null hypothesis. I wanted to see if the results of weight gain from different protein sources is statistically significant. I did this by running simulations of the study and randomizing the protein source to see if a random test would produce significantly different responses than the experiment did.\nThe following graphs show the difference in average weight gains between different proteins with the randomized test, which shows what might happen if the type of protein had no effect. The hot pink vertical line shows the average weight gain from the study that was run. The p-values below each chart show the probability under the null hypothesis (our randomized experiment) of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one obtained. The p-values are calculated by looking at how many of the randomized statistics are greater than or equal to the observed statistics from the rat study.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeef vs. Pork p-value: 0.297 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeef vs. Cereal p-value: 0.316 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPork vs. Cereal p-value: 0.303 \n\n\nAs we can see, all of the p-values are close to 0.3. Generally, if the p-value is less than 0.05, we will consider the results of the study statistically significant. Because these results are well over the point of statistical significance, we can fail to reject the null hypothesis and claim that the difference in weight gains due to different proteins is not statistically significant."
