    "text": "Rat Graph\nThis graph shows the proportion of rats per person for each state. One might use this if they have either a strong like or dislike for rats and are willing to relocate accordingly. Someone who really loves rats and would like to cohabitate with them may wish to check out New York, as we see that there is about a rat for each person residing there. On the other hand, someone who is looking to stay as far away as possible might have better luck with somewhere like Colorado, where they will find closer to 1 rat for every 10 people."

    "text": "2016 WI Congressional Districts\nThis map shows the congressional Districts in WI as of 2016. The colors from blue to red represent how respectively Democratic or Republican that district voted in the 2016 elections for Congress.\nOne interesting aspect is the shapes of the districts. We see that some districts, like Districts 3 & 4 are very oddly shaped. District 3 seems to reach up into areas like Stevens Point and Eau Claire, while District 4 is by far the smallest, and covers little more than Milwaukee. This could bring up accusations of gerrymandering, especially seeing as the two weirdest shaped districts are also 2 of the 3 that elected Democratic Representatives. If, for example, District 4 was a bit bigger, it might draw some of the republican votes away from their respective districts and make those districts more competitive and at risk of turning blue. The size of District 7 is also notable. It is likely that there are some more liberal areas in NW Wisconsin around Superior, however their votes would be cancelled out by the large span of conservative areas in northcentral WI.\nWe also see that the darkness of the color corresponds to the proportion of votes. For example, districts 3 & 4 have no Republican votes because they were uncontested competitions. The majority of the Republican winning counties had around 60-65% of the vote.\nWI Governor Evers recently signed a bill passing a new Legislative Districts map to combat some of this gerrymandering, however thus far the Congressional Districts have remained the same."

    "text": "Circlize Package\nThe circlize package is very helpful in displaying data circularly. This can allow up to stack different types of charts about the same data, as shown below, and it also has many benefits pertaining to looking at connections between variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis next chart is just an example of how one might facet these charts. You can, of course, have multiple circles that all display data and charts, however for this example I choose to just play with their colors and brightness.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the first two graphs were just playing around with the package with random variables, this last graph is a real world example of how the circlize package might be used. The World Phones dataset shows the amount of phones in different regions of the world throughout a few years. I am using it with the chordDiagram function to show the relationship between the regions and years where there were phones.\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load circlize package\nlibrary(circlize)\n\n# Load WorldPhones dataset\ndata(\"WorldPhones\")\n\n# Create a circular plot\nchordDiagram(WorldPhones, transparency = 0.5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](rtip_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, this link will take you to a presentation overview of the circlize dataset and some of its uses."
