## Mary Kreklow

*Welcome!*

I'm Mary Kreklow, a junior at St. Olaf College, studying quantitative economics with concentrations in statistics & data science and international relations. My academic journey is driven by a commitment to understanding complex systems—whether that’s through data analysis, policy evaluation, or modeling solutions for real-world issues. Outside the classroom, I lead as a SOAR Peer Leader and Senior Admissions Fellow, and I’m actively involved in music ensembles and campus organizations. With a passion for helping others and finding good in the world, I’m excited to work on projects that reflect my dedication to bridging gaps and uplifting communities.

Here, you’ll find a collection of projects that showcase my curiosity and creativity, offering a playful take on data-driven insights.
